Welcome to the ODES scikit documentation!
=========================================

The ODES scikit provides access to Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers and Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE) solvers.

A convenience function `odeint` is available for fast and fire and forget integration. Object oriented class solvers `ode` and `dae` are available for fine control. Finally, the low levels solvers are also directly exposed for specialised needs.
