This is a scikit offering some extra ode/dae solvers, so they can mature outside of scipy. 

Requirement
===========
* You need scipy, as the aim is to extend scipy.integrate
* You need a fortran compiler to install from source. 
* You need cython installed to install from source
* Tested with python 2.7 and 3.2

Requirements before install
===========================
1. You need numpy and scipy installed
2. You need to have cython installed and executable
3. You need to have the sundials package version 2.4.0 installed from 
https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/download/download.html
This package *must* be installed with the MPI disabled and the fPIC flag. On a *nix systhem, do after extraction of the downloaded tar.gz:

./configure --disable-mpi --with-cflags=-fPIC
make
and as root:
make install

This should install sundials in /usr/local/lib

Installation from sources
=========================

In the directory example (the same as the file you are reading now), just do as root:

python setup.py build

This builds the packages in the build directory.
You can try it without installation using PYTHONPATH. For example:
On my box, the build libs are in odes/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/, hence I can
use them with:

PYTHONPATH=/path-to-odes/odes/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/  python -c'import scikits.odes.sundials'

To install, as root:

python setup.py install

Usage
=====
This installs the scikit, to use it in your python scripts use eg:

from scikits.odes import dae

For examples, see the tests directory with the tests. 

Tests
=====
To run the tests do in the python shell:

>>> import scikits.odes
>>> scikits.odes.test()

NOTE: at the moment (11/2008) the above tests() only work in the old style of python installs (.egg directory or normal install), not with zipped eggs. So for above to work you need to install in the old method:

1. remove existing install. From the root directory where you downloaded scikits.odes:
sudo easy_install -m scikits.odes
sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/scikits.odes*
sudo rm -rf scikits.odes.egg-info
sudo rm -rf build

2. reinstall:

sudo python setup.py install --single-version-externally-managed --root /

note, use the flag: --install-layout=deb on debian systems

Alternatively:

use easy_install to install latest version
